Control of OTT'\n\n•  Newly passed amendment to Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the age-old Sedition Act and the proposed measure to bring the OTT platforms and online news under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had created multiple controversies. Though a small spectrum of the population believe that it curbs incitement to revolution and proves to be the opportunity to prevent loss of life, damage to property while ensuring security and stability, the major half of the spectrum, inclusive of experts and activists claim that such laws may be misused in a contemporary democracy to curb political opposition and dissent. .ISSUE hopes to discuss these subjects left, right and centre by bringing in experts and eminent personalities to present their perspectives and have a fruitful and healthy interactive session with the young audience.
